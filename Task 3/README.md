# Task 3: Linear Regression

This task focuses on building and evaluating a linear regression model to predict house prices using the provided `housing.csv` dataset.

## Steps Covered

1. **Data Loading**  
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., `mainroad`, `furnishingstatus`).
   - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Split data into training and test sets.
   - Train a linear regression model on both unscaled and scaled data.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate model performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.
   - Visualize feature importance and residuals.
